This is my solution to the home assignment.

The goal was to write in several hours
an app which searches for Github repositories with support of pagination, and in general it works.

However, there are some problems I didn't solve yet:
1) I still didn't find out how to solve the authentication issue, so it fails with 403 after 10 requests
2) I didn't succeed in covering the app with unit tests. The whole solution just took too much of time and
I had to finish it as is.

But if I had more time I would also:
1) Write more tests
2) Implement search by input with Rx-style debounce
3) Fix the authentication issue
4) Create a better UI
